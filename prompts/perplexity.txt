In the next 700–1,200 words, write an essay discussing how rapid advances in artificial intelligence are reshaping human work, education, and creativity. Consider both the opportunities and challenges these changes create. Support your points with historical parallels, examples from current technology, and potential future outcomes. Your essay should have a clear thesis, logical progression of ideas, and a concluding reflection on what ethical priorities humans should adopt in guiding AI development.
Optional Style Variation: “You may choose to write from a formal, analytical, or narrative perspective, but maintain coherence and depth of thought.”
