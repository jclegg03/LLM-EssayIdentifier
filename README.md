This project was part of a deep learning class. The task was to pick a problem of my choice and try to solve it using deep learning.
I choose to try to identify the writing of various AI models. I also decided to generate my own dataset. This was done by having 5 LLMs generate prompts. I then modified the prompts to help mitigate output issues.
I then created a file for each prompt and created a python function to read all the prompts from the prompts folder using ChatGPT.
